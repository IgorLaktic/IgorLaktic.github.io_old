Supported Dashboard Items Color Schemes Overview Coloring Measures and Dimensions Customizing Color Palettes Using the Dashboard Item Menu Customizing Color Palettes Using the Color Scheme Page Supported Dashboard Items You can manage coloring for the following dashboard items. Chart Scatter Chart Pie Pie Map Range Filter Treemap Color Schemes Overview The dashboard provides two ways of coloring dashboard item elements. Global color scheme . This color scheme provides consistent colors for identical values across the dashboard. The image below shows the dashboard containing Pie and Chart dashboard items. Pie segments and chart series points corresponding to Beverages , Condiments and Confections dimension values are colored using identical colors from the default palette. Important When a global color scheme is used, the dashboard reserves automatically generated colors for certain values regardless of the filter state. Local color scheme . This color scheme provides an independent set of colors for each dashboard item. Important When a local color scheme is used, the dashboard reassigns palette colors when the filter state is changed. To select a type of coloring dashboard item elements, open the dashboard item menu , go to the Color Scheme section and use the Color Scheme Type option. Coloring Measures and Dimensions Dashboard items allow you to manage the coloring of individual dimensions or all dashboard item measures using predefined coloring modes. The following coloring settings are available. Setting Description Auto Dimension values/measures are colored by default. To learn how specific dashboard items color their elements by default, see the Coloring topic for the corresponding dashboard item . On Dimension values/measures are colored by different hues. Off Dimension values/measures are colored with the same color. You can configure coloring in two ways. To specify the coloring mode for the specific measure/dimension, open the data item menu and go to Data Shaping section. Use the Coloring option to specify coloring mode of this data item. To see a list of all measures/dimensions for which you can specify coloring mode, open the dashboard item's Options menu and go to the Coloring section. For example, the image below shows the Chart dashboard item whose Country dimension is colored by different hues... ...and this image shows the Pie dashboard item whose measures are colored by different hues. Note If you enabled coloring by different hues for several dimensions/measures, all combinations of dimension values/measures will be automatically colored using different colors from the default palette.

    "title": "Calculated Fields Overview | Metric Analitic, End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Calculated Fields Overview Calculated fields are primarily used in data-aware reports when using both standard data binding and mail merge . Calculated fields allow you to pre-process a report's input data, based on a certain expression. So, using calculated fields allows you to apply complex expressions to one or more data fields that are obtained from your report's underlying data source. Moreover, you can both group and sort your report data based on a calculated field's value. Calculated Fields Overview To create a calculated field, switch to the Field List , select a data table and click Add calculated field . Click the Edit button for the calculated field to display calculated field properties. Click the Expression property's ellipsis button. In the invoked Expression Editor , construct the required expression. You can use data fields, report parameters , predefined constants as well as various date-time, logical, math and string functions. See the next document section for more information about expression syntax. Note The Expression Editor displays only those data fields that are obtained from a data source specified by the calculated field's Data Source and Data Member property values. Switch to the Properties Panel , select the Data category and expand the Calculated Fields section to display the calculated fields collection and manage its items. You can drag the calculated field from the Field List onto the required band like an ordinary data field. You can also group and sort your report data based on the calculated field values. Expression Syntax A data field is inserted into the expression's text using its name in [ square brackets ] , and parameters are inserted using the \" ? \" prefix before their names. A calculated field's expression can evaluate the values of other calculated fields if you make sure to avoid circular references. Date-time constants must be wrapped in hashtags ( # ) (e.g., [OrderDate] >= #1/1/2009# ). To represent a null reference (one that does not refer to any object), use a question mark (e.g., [Region] != ? ). To denote strings, use apostrophes ( ' ), otherwise an error will occur. To embed an apostrophe into an expression's text, it should be preceded by another apostrophe (e.g., 'It's sample text' ). The type of a value returned by a calculated field is defined by its Field Type property. If a calculated field expression involves the use of different types, it is necessary to convert them to the same type (e.g., Max(ToDecimal([Quantity]),[UnitPrice]) ) Although a value that is returned by a calculated field is usually converted to a string (to be displayed in a text-aware report control), it can return a value of any kind. For example, if a database field contains an image, you can set a calculated field's expression to \"=...\", after which this calculated field can be bound to the Picture Box control. To construct a valid aggregate expression, use the following format, which consists of four parts. [<Collection>][<Condition>].<Aggregate>(<Expression>) <Collection> - Specifies a collection against which an aggregated value should be calculated. It can be the relationship name in a case of a master-detail relationship, or the name of a collection property exposed by the target class. For example, [CategoriesProducts][[CategoryId]>5].Count() . Empty brackets [] indicate the root collection. <Condition> - Specifies a condition defining which records should participate in calculating an aggregate function. To obtain an aggregated value against all records, delete this logical clause along with square brackets (for example, [].Count() ). <Aggregate> - Specifies one of the available aggregate functions. <Expression> - Specifies an expression evaluating values to be used to perform calculation. For example, [][[CategoryID] > 5].Sum([UnitPrice]*[Quantity]) . The Count function does not require field values to count the records, so leave the round brackets empty for this function. You can refer to the currently processed group using the Parent Relationship Traversal Operator ('^'). This allows you to calculate aggregates within groups using expressions like the following: [][[^.CategoryID] == [CategoryID]].Sum([UnitPrice]) . For more information, see Expression Syntax .

    "keywords": "Edit Content in Print Preview This document provides information about interactive document editing in Print Preview that enables you to customize field values directly in a previewed document before printing or exporting it. Content Editing Overview When content editing is enabled for a report control (either unbound or data-aware), it is possible to customize the corresponding field values in Print Preview. To enable content editing for a report control, expand the Behavior category, select the Edit Options section and set the Enabled property to Yes . When the Enabled property is set to Yes and the ReadOnly property is set to No , the control's content can be edited in Print Preview (clicking a field will invoke the appropriate editor). To highlight all editing fields available in a document, click the Editing Fields button on the Print Preview toolbar. This button is disabled when there are no such fields in a document. Content Editing Specifics When enabling content editing in your report, consider the following. The changes made to a control's content in Print Preview have no effect on other parts of the document (e.g., the related summary results, grouping, sorting, bookmarks and other settings that have already been processed before generating the document). A control's Can Grow setting is ignored for editing fields. Multi-line values can only be entered when no mask is applied to an editing field. The editing area of a field cannot exceed the original dimensions of a control. Values entered into editing fields are reset back to their defaults after refreshing the document (e.g., when submitting report parameter values and expanding or collapsing data in a drill-down report ). It is impossible to edit content of a control that has its Drill-Down Control property specified. Field values entered in Print Preview for controls placed onto the Top Margin and Bottom Margin bands are not preserved when the report is exported to TXT or CSV, as well as the following formats as a single file. HTML MHT RTF XLS XLSX image To learn about the specifics of editing different kinds of content, see the following sections in this document. Text Editors Character Comb Editors Check Box Editor Image Editors Text Editors The Label , Table Cell and Character Comb controls can be assigned editors to customize their content in Print Preview. To enable content editing for these controls, expand the Behavior category, select the Edit Options section and set the Enabled property to Yes . The following editors can be used to customize a field's content in Print Preview. Default Editor By default, the Editor Name property is not specified, and a memo edit is used as a standard editor. Specific Value Editors You can assign a specific editor to a control using its Editor Name property. Note This option is disabled for the Character Comb control. Note If a table cell contains other controls, its editing is disabled (but not the editing of the controls contained in this cell), which is illustrated in the following image. Character Comb Editors The Character Comb control displays text so that each character is printed in an individual cell. Specify the Character Comb's Edit Options | Editor Name property to use a text editor, as described in the Text Editors section above. Check Box Editor The Check Box control's value can be edited in Print Preview. To enable content editing for a check box, expand the Behavior category, select the Edit Options section and set the Enabled property to Yes . In Print Preview, the control's behavior depends on the Group ID setting. When this property is set to null or an empty string value, a check box can be switched either to the \"checked\" or \"unchecked\" state (the \"intermediate\" state is not supported) independently on other available check boxes. Otherwise, the field editor behaves like a radio button, and editors with the same Group ID value belong to a single logical group (i.e., only one option can be selected within a group at a time). Image Editors Image editors are used to customize the Picture Box report control's content in Print Preview. To enable content editing for a picture box, expand the Behavior category, select the Edit Options section and set the Enabled property to Yes . Use the control's Editor Name property to assign one of the following image editors. Image Editor Allows you to load an image and specify the image's size options. Signature Editor Allows you to specify brush options and draw a signature. Image and Signature Editor (default) Allows you to load an image and draw a signature. The image's size options and brush options are available. All the image editors listed above can include the menu item. This item is available only when the Picture Box control has an original image.

First Down, then Across The report data is arranged vertically and is wrapped to the next column on reaching the bottom page margin. When the report data is grouped, you can make each group start on a new column by setting the Page Break property of the Group Footer to After the Band . How It Works The following image illustrates a report designer with a multi-column layout applied to the report: In multi-column mode, the report's design surface is limited to the area defined by the column width. This is the only area intended to contain report controls. The rest of this surface defines the space on a page remaining for printing columns and column spacing area. In the above image, the report data in the Detail band is contained within a Panel that provides borders around the enclosed content. You can also specify a custom background color for the Panel. To learn how to change this color dynamically (based on the report's underlying data), see Conditionally Change a Control's Appearance . When the report data is grouped (as in the above image), and the First Down, then Across multi-column layout is used, you can make each group start on a new column. To do this, set the Page Break property of the Group Footer to After the Band or After the Band, Except for the Last Entry . When there is no data to display in the Group Footer, set the band height to zero."

    "keywords": "Query Builder The Query Builder is a visual queries editor. You can invoke it from the Data Source Wizard . Select Tables Drag and drop a specific table or view onto the Query Builder design surface to include it into a query result set. The Query Builder provides a toolbar with the following commands: Icon Description Removes the selected table or view from the query. Reverses the most recent action. Performs the previously undone action. Enable check boxes for the table columns you want to include into the query result set. Use the dedicated search box to find a specific table or view. Join Tables The Query Builder allows you to join tables and/or views. Use drag and drop to connect corresponding columns (key fields). The connected columns should have identical data types. Click the data relation to display the Relation Properties section. Properties in this section define the join type ( Inner or Left Outer ) and applied logical operator. A left outer join returns all the values from an inner join along with all values in the \"left\" table that do not match to the \"right\" table and includes rows with NULL (empty) values in the key field. If you select the left outer join, the relationship line displays an arrow which points at the \"right\" table of the join clause. The executed query returns a \"flat\" table which joins different tables within a single query. The specified join options define which data records compose the query result set. Note We recommend you to use hierarchical data sources because the reporting engine generates master-detail reports faster than similar-looking reports which obtains data from \"flat\" data sources. Filter Data Expand the Query Properties section to display the query options. The query provides the following options: Name Specifies a custom query name (alias). Filter Runs the Filter Editor where you can specify filter conditions for the resulting data. Filter criteria may contain query parameters . Group Filter Runs the Filter Editor where you can specify filter conditions for grouped and aggregated data. This option is enabled only for grouped data. Select All (*) Specifies whether to include all columns from the selected tables and/or views to the query result set, regardless of their individual settings. The default value is No . Select Top Specifies the number of first records to include to the query result set. The default value is 0 and indicates that the query result set contains all records that meet all other filter conditions. Offset Specifies the number of records to skip before the report engine retrieves data. This option is available only for sorted data. Select distinct Specifies whether to include only distinct values to the result set. The default value is No . Shape Data Select a table or view and click a data column to display the data column options. The Column Properties section contains the following options: Name Indicates the column name which the Query Builder obtains from the database. Type Indicates the column's data type. The Query Builder provides information about the maximum string length for string columns. Alias Specifies a custom column name (alias). Include a column into a query to enable this option. Output Specifies whether to include the column into the query result set. Sort Type Specifies whether to preserve the original data records' order within the column, or sort them (in an ascending or descending order). Sort Order Apply sorting to the data column's records to enable this option. It defines the sorting priority for multiple columns (the less this number is, the higher the priority). For example, set the sort order to 1 for the column A and set it to 2 for the column B . The Query Builder first sorts the query by column A and then by the column B . All columns' sort order automatically updates when you change this setting for one column. It allows you to avoid conflict of priorities. Group By Specifies whether to group the query result set by this column. Note You should apply grouping and/or aggregation to each selected column. Aggregate Specifies whether to aggregate the column's data records. You can use the following aggregate functions: Count , Max , Min , Avg , Sum , CountDistinct , AvgDistinct , SumDistinct . The Query Builder discards individual data records from the query result set and keep only the aggregate function result when you apply any of these functions.

Since the resulting UPC-E bar code is about half the size as an UPC-A bar code, UPC-E is generally used on products with very small packaging, where a full UPC-A bar code could not reasonably fit. The UPC-E0 is a kind of UPC-E code with the number system set to 0 . In the human readable string of the bar code the first digit signifies the number system (always 0 for this code type), and the last digit is the check digit of the original UPC-A code. In the example below, the original UPC-A code is \" 04210000526 \". We should remove the leading zero when assigning the string to the control's property, since the code format itself implies its presence. The checksum digit ( 4 ) is calculated automatically, and the symbology algorithm transforms the rest of the numeral string. The result is 425261 , and it is encoded along with the number system prefix and the check digit into the scanner-readable form. Not every UPC-A code can be transformed into the UPC-E0 (it must meet special requirements)."

It is called simply, a \"UPC bar code\" or \"UPC Symbol.\" The UPC-A bar code contains 12 digits, no letters or other characters. The first digit is the prefix signifying the product type. The last digit is the \"check digit\". The check digit is calculated using first eleven figures when the bar code is constructed. So, for the correct UPC-A you should specify only the first 11 digits. The recommended dimensions are shown in the picture. The standard allows magnification up to 200 %, and reduction of up to 80 % of the recommended size. There should be two quiet zones before and after the bar code. They provide reliable operation of the bar code scanner. The quiet zone recommended length is 2.97 mm for the bar code of standard width and height."

The following image illustrates the resulting report with a hierarchical Document Map. Clicking any bookmark navigates the Print Preview to the document section containing the associated element. Use the following steps to generate a Documnet Map in your grouped report. Select the label placed in the Group Header band and switch to the Expressions panel. Click the Bookmark property's ellipsis button, and in the invoked Expression Editor , select the CategoryName data field. In the legacy binding mode (if the Designer does not provide the Expressions panel), you can specify this property in the Properties panel's Data Bindings category. In the same way, select the label in the Detail band and bind its Bookmark property to the ProductName data field. Most of the reporting controls (for example, Table , TableCell, CheckBox , etc.) supports the Bookmark property. Set the same label's Parent Bookmark property to the label in the group band. This arranges bookmarks into a parent-child structure reflecting the report elements' hierarchy in the Document Map. Note Avoid cyclic bookmarks that occur when you assign two bookmarks as parents to each other. In this scenario, an exception raises when you attempt to create the report document. Select the report itself and assign text to its Bookmark property to determine the root node's caption in the Document Map .

    "keywords": "Introduction to Banded Reports Banded reports provide a generalized report layout notion. When you preview a banded report, a report document is generated based on the report layout and data source. Report Bands A report layout consists of bands that contain report controls and define their location on document pages. A blank report contains the following bands: The Detail Band displays recurring contents from the report's data source. This band is printed as many times as there are records available in a data source unless you filtered the data. Every report must have a detail band, and you cannot delete it. The top and bottom page Margin bands . These bands are repeated once on every document page. You can also add the following bands: Report Header and Report Footer The Report Header is the report's first band (margins are \"out-of-page\" zones). Use this band to display the report's name, company logo, date of creation, username , etc. The Report Footer is placed before the Page Footer and Bottom Margin on the report's last page. You can use the Report Footer band for report summaries or conclusions. Page Header and Page Footer These bands are at the top and bottom of every page in a report. They display information that should be printed on every page. Group Header and Group Footer These bands are above and below each group . Tip Only the detail and group bands can be used to display dynamic data source contents. Other bands display titles, summaries, and extra information . The following image illustrates a sample report layout and the Report Explorer panel that reflects the report's structure: Add a Detail Band to a Master-Detail Band Use the detail report band to create hierarchical master-detail reports . Detail report bands provide detailed information about each record in the master report's detail band. You can create such reports when master-detail relationships are defined between data source tables: A detail report band is a separate report (subreport) with its own data source and different bands. A report can have any number of detail reports that can also be nested. The following image illustrates a master-detail report and the Report Explorer panel that reflects the report's structure: Vertical Bands You can replace the Detail band with the Vertical Header , Vertical Detail and Vertical Total bands to display record fields vertically and print data records horizontally - from left to right. Note If your report's Detail band contains report controls, this band and all these controls are lost when you add a vertical band (the same behavior takes place in the opposite situation). The following vertical bands are available: Vertical Header Contains headers of the report's data fields. These headers are arranged one after another in a vertical direction. Vertical Details Displays recurring contents from the report's data source. This band is printed as many times as there are available records in a data source, unless you filtered the data. The records are displayed one after another in a horizontal direction. Vertical Total This band is placed at the rightmost position (leftmost when RTL is enabled). You can use the Vertical Total band for report summaries or conclusions. Tip See Create a Vertical Report for details on how to use vertical bands. Create Band Copies You can create functional copies of a band, for example, to display different contents based on a specific condition. To do this, add sub-bands to bands. Tip See Laying out Dynamic Report Contents for details on how to specify the location of bands' content on document pages. Manage Report Bands Hide Bands in the Report Designer Select a band and click on the band's tab title to collapse or expand the band. Hide Bands in the Report Document You can avoid printing a band's content in a document. To do this, set the band's Visible property to false . Select the band and set this property in the Properties Panel . Remove Bands Select a band on the report design surface and press DELETE. This removes the band and all its content. Add Bands To add a band, select the report or any of its bands in the Properties panel and click an appropriate item in the Actions category. You can insert a detail report band if the report's data source has master-detail relations . Click Insert Detail Report in the Actions category."

The most important characteristic of a series is its type, which determines a particular visual representation of data. The Chart dashboard item includes the following series types. A Bar series displays data as sets of rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. Point and Line series display data as standalone points or points joined by a line. An Area series displays data by a line that joins points, and the shaded area between the line and the argument axis. A Range series is the area between two simple series displayed as a shaded area, or bars that stretch from a point in one series to the corresponding point in another series. A Weighted series displays data using a third dimension, expressed by a bubble's size. Financial series are useful in analyzing stock and bond prices, as well as the behavior of commodities. Tooltip The Chart dashboard item can display a tooltip that shows information on a hovered series point."

Make sure that your software vendor allows you to use scripts. The Script Editor allows you to write code for specific event handlers in the End-User Report Designer to adjust the behavior of report controls, bands, or a report itself. This topic describes the basic principles of using scripts, the Script Editor interface and shows how scripting can be used in a report. Overview Scripts are program commands, placed within the event handlers of the required report elements. And, when the corresponding event occurs (e.g. a mouse click), the script code runs. You can write scripts for a report or any of its elements (bands and controls), to be executed when the report is being previewed, printed or exported . The Script Editor provides you the capability to write and execute scripts. Use this editor if you want to slightly customize a report in the End-User Report Designer. The Script Editor supports C# , Visual Basic .NET and JScript .NET scripting languages. This means that the scripting language is independent from the language used to create the report. The language is specified by the Script Language property. The selected scripting language must be the same for all scripts used in a report. The Script Editor supports intelligent code completion that makes it easier and faster to write scripts. Context-aware hints are displayed on pressing CTRL+spacebar. This feature is only supported for the C# and Visual Basic .NET script languages. Intelligent code completion is available only for .NET Framework and DevExpress libraries deployed with the application and cannot be provided for custom assemblies. Maintaining Scripts Each report element has its own set of events that can be handled by the Script Editor. To handle an event of a report element, do the following. Click the Scripts button located on the End-User Report Designer's Main Toolbar . In the displayed Script Editor, specify the report control and its event by the toolbar. The toolbar contains all scripts written for all report elements, and allows you to quickly navigate through them by choosing the required report element in the corresponding drop-down list and specifying one of its available events in another menu. After the event is specified, a code template is generated in the current scripting language. To check for errors in the report's script, click the Validate button. If an error is found, the string containing this error is marked with an icon. When a mouse pointer hovers over this icon, the text of the error is displayed."

If a property's editor displays an ellipsis button, you can click this button to invoke the Expression Editor and specify an expression that evaluates to the property's value. The Expression Editor offers a choice of functions, operators, data source fields, report elements, constants, and variables to create an expression. An expression can span multiple lines. You can add single-line or multi-line comments in the following format: /* comment text */ . The Expression Editor highlights an expression's syntax and supports intelligent code completion (it suggests functions and available data elements as you type). An error icon appears if an expression contains errors. Hover the mouse pointer over this icon to invoke a pop-up notification that shows the location of the error. See the Expression Syntax topic for the expression syntax description. Expression Syntax Take into account the following syntax conventions when using the Expression Editor: Reference a data field in the expression by enclosing its name in the square brackets (for example, [ProductName] ). Insert report parameters and query parameters by typing a question mark before their names (for instance, ?parameter1 ). Denote string values with apostrophes. Type a double apostrophe to embed an apostrophe into an expression's text (for example, 'It''s sample text' ). Enclose date-time constants with hashtags ( [OrderDate] >= #1/1/2016# ). Use a question mark to specify a null reference (one that does not refer to any object) ( [Region] != ? ). If an expression involves the use of different types, you can convert them to the same type using dedicated functions (for instance, Max(ToDecimal([Quantity]),[UnitPrice]) ). Using the Expression Editor When expression bindings are enabled in your reports, the Report Designer contains the Expressions tab allowing you to assign values to various element properties. Clicking any property's ellipsis button invokes the Expression Editor, in which you can specify custom expressions with the available data fields.

Invoke the designer menu and click Add Data Source... . Select Database on the first page of the invoked Data Source Wizard and click Next . Select a data connection on the next page. On the same page, you can choose which tables, views and/or stored procedures to add to the report. Obtain data from two different tables to display information about customers and orders at the same hierarchical level in the report. Click the plus button for the Queries category to create a custom query. In the invoked Query Builder , add the required data tables to a query and join them based on a key column. On the same wizard page, select the data view providing order details for listing products included in each order in the invoice. On the same page, specify a master-detail relationship between the queries. Select the required key fields (columns) to connect tables. Click Finish to complete the wizard. After these steps, make sure that an appropriate data member is assigned to the report. Prepare the Master Report Layout Create the master report layout to display basic information about customers and their orders. Switch to the Field List and drop the required data fields onto the Detail band . New controls of appropriate types are automatically created and bound to the corresponding fields. Drop Label controls from the Toolbox onto the band to display static captions for specific data fields. Double-click the added labels one after another and enter the required text. Use the Line control to separate data. Prepare the Detail Report Layout Perform the following steps to create a detail report and construct its layout to show the order details in a tabular form: Expand the Actions category and click Insert Detail Report Band to create a Detail Report Band . Select the Detail Report band and select the master-detail relationship's name in the Data Member property's drop-down list. Add dynamic content to the detail report. Go to the Field List , select the data fields while holding down CTRL or SHIFT and drag-and-drop them onto the Detail band. This automatically creates a Table control with table cells bound to the corresponding fields. You should drag-and-drop fields from the category corresponding to the master-detail relationship to correctly generate the detail report's data. Add the Group Header band to the detail report to display captions for table columns. Select the Detail Report band and click Insert Group Header Band in the Actions category. To create column headers, drop the Table control from the Toolbox onto the Group Header band and enter the required text in the table's cells. Select the Detail Report band, expand the Behavior category and set the band's Page Break property to After the Band to print each order on a separate page. Create a Calculated Field This section demonstrates how to create a custom field whose values are calculated using a pre-defined expression. Do the following to evaluate an extended price based on the price, quantity and discount values obtained from a database: In the Field List , select the detail table and click Add calculated field . Click the Edit button for the calculated field and change its name to ExtendedPrice . Click the Expression property's ellipsis button, and in the invoked Expression Editor , construct the expression based on the UnitPrice , Quantity and Discount fields. You can use the created calculated field as an ordinary data field. Add a cell to a table in the Detail band and drop the calculated field onto this cell. Additionally, create one more table cell in the Group Header for displaying the corresponding caption. Format Data The next step is to specify report elements' value formatting to improve displaying their incoming data. In the master report's Detail band, select controls bound to date fields while holding down CTRL. Switch to the Properties panel, expand the Data category and click the Text Format String property's ellipsis button. In the invoked Format String Editor , activate the DateTime category and select the format, for example, display dates as a month (name) followed by the day (number) and year (four digits). Select the table cell bound to the Discount data field in the detail report's Detail band. Expand the Actions category, click the Text Format String property's ellipsis button, and in the invoked Format String Editor , apply the Percent format. In this case, field values are multiplied by 100 and displayed with a percent symbol. In the detail report's Detail band, select the cells bound to the UnitPrice and ExtendedPrice fields. Invoke the Format String Editor once again and choose the format preset from the Currency category (for instance, c2 ). Calculate a Summary Do the following to calculate a total price for each order as a sum of Extended Price values: Add the Group Footer band to the detail report in the same way as the Group Header. Drop the Label control onto the added band and expand the Actions category in the Properties panel. Select the Summary section and set the Running property to Report to calculate the summary for the entire detail report and click the Expression property's ellipsis button. In the invoked Expression Editor , specify the following expression to calculate the total price: Use the Text Format String property to format the summary's value (for instance, set it to Total: {0:c2} ). Sort Data Perform the following steps to sort data in the detail report: Select the Detail band in the detail report. Select the Sort Fields section in the Actions category and add a new sort field to sort the detail report's data by the required data field. Click the or buttons to define the sort order within the group (ascending or descending). Use the button to disable sorting in grouped data. Customize the Report Appearance Do the following to customize the report and its elements' appearance: Click the gray area around the design surface to select the report, and in the Properties panel, specify the font settings. These settings are distributed to all report elements. You can adjust a control's font independently from its parent (for instance, make summary values bold). Change specific controls' (bound to date fields, price fields, etc.) text alignment using the Text Alignment property. Create a global visual style to apply it afterwards to multiple controls. Switch to the Report Explorer panel, select the Styles node and click the plus button to add a new report visual style. Select the created style and click the Properties button in the Report Explorer. This opens the Properties panel where you can adjust the settings of the selected style. Select report elements, expand the Styles category and choose a style in the Style property's drop-down list to apply the style to the selected elements. You can provide different appearances to alternating (odd and even) table rows in the detail report. Select the table and expand the Styles property in the Property Grid. Invoke the drop-down list for the EvenStyle property and select New . Specify the created style's appearance settings (for example, background color). Add Additional Information Do the following to provide additional information to your invoices, such as the report name and current date: Add the Page Header band to the master report to display the required information on each invoice page. Drop the Label control from the Toolbox onto the Page Header, double-click the control and type \" Invoice \". Specify the required appearance settings (font, foreground color, etc.). Add the Page Info control to the Page Header band to display system date in the report. Expand the Actions category and set the Page Information property to Current Date and Time .

    "title": "Expression Constants, Operators, and Functions | Metric Analitic, End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Expression Constants, Operators, and Functions The DevExpress Dashboard uses criteria language that you can use in various DevExpress products for building expressions. An expression is a string that evaluates some value. The criteria language is based on the the cross-platform library with some additions and subtractions specific for dashboards. This topic details basic and dashboard-specific constants, operators, and functions. The tables below contain constants, operators, and functions you can use in dashboard expressions. Constants Constant Description Example String constants Wrap string constants in apostrophes. If a string contains an apostrophe, double the apostrophe. [Country] == 'France' or [Name] == 'O''Neil' Date-time constants Wrap date-time constants in '#'. [OrderDate] >= #2018-03-22 13:18:51.94944# True Represents the Boolean True value. [InStock] == True False Represents the Boolean False value. [InStock] == False Enumeration Specify an enumeration value using its underlying integer value. Note that you cannot specify an enumeration value using its qualified name. [Status] == 1 Guid Wrap a Guid constant in curly braces. Use Guid constants in a relational operation with equality or inequality operators only. [OrderID] == {513724e5-17b7-4ec6-abc4-0eae12c72c1f} Numeric Specify different numeric constant types in a string form using suffixes: Int32 (int) - 1 , Int16 (short) - 1s , Byte (byte) - 1b , Double (double) - 1.0 , Single (float) - 1.0f , Decimal (decimal) - 1.0m , [Price] == 25.0m ? Represents a null reference that does not refer to any object. We recommend using the IsNull unary operator (for example, \"[Region] is null\") or the IsNull logical function (for example, \"IsNull([Region])\") instead. [Region] != ? You can build parameterized criteria using any number of positional parameters. To do this, add parameter placeholders (question mark characters) to a criteria expression to identify parameter positions and provide a list of parameter values. When building criteria, parameter placeholders are substituted with parameter values in values in the order they are listed. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[Name] == ? and [Age] == ?\", \"John\", 33) The following two examples are identical, but the second one allows you to avoid formatting errors. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[OrderDate] >= #1/1/2009#\") CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[OrderDate] >= ?\", new DateTime(2009, 1, 1)) When parameters are not specified, a parameter placeholder is substituted with null. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[Region] != ?\") Operators Operator Description Example + Adds the value of one numeric expression to another or concatenates two strings. [UnitPrice] + 4 or [FirstName] + ' ' + [LastName] - Finds the difference between two numbers. [Price1] - [Price2] * Multiplies the value of two expressions. [Quantity] * [UnitPrice] * (1 - [BonusAmount]) / Divides the first operand by the second. [Quantity] / 2 % Returns the remainder (modulus) obtained by dividing one numeric expression by another. [Quantity] % 3 | Performs a bitwise inclusive OR on two numeric expressions. Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 0. [Flag1] & The bitwise AND operator. Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 0. [Flag] & 10 ^ Performs a bitwise exclusive OR on two numeric expressions. [Flag1] ^ [Flag2] == Returns true if both operands have the same value; otherwise, it returns false. [Quantity] == 10 = Returns true if both operands have the same value; otherwise, it returns false. [Quantity] = 10 != Returns true if the operands do not have the same value; otherwise, it returns false. [Country] != 'France' < Less than operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] < 20 <= Less than or equal to operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] <= 20 >= Greater than or equal to operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] >= 30 > Greater than operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] > 30 In (,,,) Tests for the existence of a property in an object. [Country] In ('USA', 'UK', 'Italy') Between (,) Specifies a range to test. Returns true if a value is greater than or equal to the first operand and less than or equal to the second operand. [Quantity] Between (10, 20) And Performs a logical conjunction on two Boolean expressions. [InStock] And ([ExtendedPrice]> 100) && Performs a logical conjunction on two Boolean expressions. [InStock] && ([ExtendedPrice]> 100) Or Performs a logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions. [Country]=='USA' Or [Country]=='UK' | Performs a logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions. [Country]=='USA' | [Country]=='UK' ~ Performs a bitwise negation on a numeric expression. ~[Roles] = 251 Not Performs a logical negation on a Boolean expression. Not [InStock] ! Performs a logical negation on a Boolean expression. ![InStock] + Returns a numeric expression's value (a unary operator). +[Value] = 10 - Returns the negative of a numeric expression's value (a unary operator). -[Value] = 20 Is Null Returns true if an expression is a null reference, the one that does not refer to any object. [Region] is null Functions Advanced Functions - Intermediate Aggregation Level Function Description Example aggr(SummaryExpression, Dimensions) Uses the detail level specified by a predefined set of dimensions and a specified summary function to aggregate underlying data. aggr(Sum([Sales]), [Category], [Product]) w(WindowExpression, partitionByFunction, orderByFunction) Calculates aggregated values with the specified window function for the window defined by the specified partitioning and ordering. w(RankDense(Sum([ProductSales]), 'desc'), partitionBy([CategoryName]), orderBy()) partitionBy(column1, column2, ...)

For instance, the operators are performed in a default order in the first of the following two code samples. In the second code sample, the addition operation is performed first, because its associated elements are grouped with parentheses, and the multiplication operation is performed last. Amount == 2 + 48 * 2 Amount == (2 + 48) * 2 Case Sensitivity Operators are case insensitive. Although field values’ case sensitivity depends on the data source. Note A data source affects certain operators' behavior. For instance, by default, the SQL Server Express 2005 is configured as case insensitive. In this case, the following expression always evaluates to true : Lower(Name) == Upper(Name) Escape Keywords You can mark a keyword-like field name with an escape character (@ sign). In the expression below, the CriteriaOperator.Parse method interprets @Or as the field named \"Or\", not the logical operator OR. @Or = 'value' Escape Characters Use a backslash () as an escape character for characters in expressions. Examples: \\[ \\\\ \\'"

This topic shows how to evaluate calculated fields on a visualization (summary) and intermediate levels. Summary Level Aggregations To compute values of the calculated field on a visualization (or summary) level, you can use a set of predefined aggregate functions. In the Expression Editor , these functions are available within the Functions | Aggregate . Function Description Example Aggr(SummaryExpression, Dimensions) Aggregates underlying data using the detail level specified by a predefined set of dimensions and a specified summary function. Aggr(Sum([Sales]), [Category], [Product]) Avg(Value) Returns the average of all the values in the expression. Avg([Profit]) Count() Returns the number of values. Count() CountNotNull(Value) Returns a number of non-null objects in a collection. CountNotNull([Orders]) CountDistinct(Value) Returns the number of distinct values. CountDistinct([Orders]) Max(Value) Returns the maximum value across all records. Max([Profit]) Min(Value) Returns the minimum value across all records. Min([Profit]) Mode(Value) Returns the mode of the values. Mode([Profit]) Median(Value) Returns the median of the values. Median([Profit]) Sum(Value) Returns the sum of all values. Sum([Profit]) Var(Value) Returns an estimate of the variance of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. Var([Orders]) Varp(Value) Returns the variance of a population, where the population is the entire data to be summarized. Varp([Orders]) StdDev(Value) Returns an estimate of the standard deviation of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. StdDev([Orders]) StdDevp(Value) Returns the standard deviation of a population, where the population is the entire data to be summarized. StdDevp([Orders]) These functions can be used for all types of numeric fields. After creating such calculated fields, you can use them as measures contained in an OLAP cube. Intermediate Level Aggregations The Web Dashboard can aggregate and summarize data on different levels. The Query Builder allows you to prepare an underlying data source before analyzing data. You can apply grouping, sorting, summarization and other data shaping operations during data selection. Dashboard items aggregate and summarize data at a visualization level using dimensions and measures, respectively. To learn more, see Binding Dashboard Items to Data . The Aggr function introduces an intermediate detail level that is not related to the visualization level. This allows you to create custom aggregations at different levels and combine these aggregations with existing visualizations."

The UPC-E1 is a variation of UPC-E code with the number system set to \" 1 \". In the human readable string of the bar code the first digit signifies the number system (always 1 for this code type), the last digit is the check digit of the original UPC-A code. In the example below, the original UPC-A code is \" 14210000526 \". We should remove the leading \" 1 \" when assigning the string to the control's property, since the code format itself implies its presence. The checksum digit ( 1 ) is calculated automatically, and the symbology algorithm transforms the rest of the numeral string. The result is 425261 , and it is encoded along with the number system prefix and the check digit into the scanner-readable form.

You can choose whether to use a global color scheme to provide consistent colors for identical values or specify a local color scheme for each dashboard item. To learn more about coloring concepts common for all dashboard items, see Coloring . By default, the Treemap dashboard item colors its tiles in the following way. If the Treemap contains only measures (the Values section), values corresponding to different measures are colored by different hues. If the Treemap contains arguments (the Arguments section), values corresponding to the first argument are colored by different hues. If necessary, you can change the default behavior. For example, the image below shows the Treemap dashboard item whose measures and argument values are painted with the same color. To change the default coloring behavior, go to the Coloring section of the Treemap's Options menu. Note You can change the default palette used to color Treemap tiles.

This means for instance, if the summary is calculated for a group, then the record number is calculated only within that group, and is reset every time a new group is started. In a simple scenario, you may not pass a parameter. See also: Displaying Row Numbers in a Report, Group or Page sumRecordNumber() sumRunningSum(Expression) Summarizes all the values, which were printed before the current data row, with the current data row's value. sumRunningSum([UnitPrice]) sumStdDev(Expression) Calculates the standard deviation of all the values within the specified summary region (group, page or report). sumStdDev([UnitPrice]) sumStdDevP(Expression) Calculates the standard population deviation of all the values within the specified summary region (group, page or report). sumStdDevP([UnitPrice]) sumSum(Expression) Calculates the total of all the values within the specified summary region (group, page or report). sumSum([UnitsInStock]) sumVar(Expression) Calculates the amount of variance for all the values within the specified summary region (group, page or report). sumVar([UnitPrice]) sumVarP(Expression) Calculates the population variance of all the values within the specified summary region (group, page or report). sumVarP([UnitPrice]) sumWAvg(Expression, Expression) Calculates the weighted average of all the values within the specified summary region (group, page or report). This type of summary returns the result of the following operation: Sum(Expression1 * Expression2) / Sum(Expression2). sumWAvg([UnitPrice]) Refer to Report Items In Expressions A report's elements are displayed in the Report Designer's Report Explorer. You can access these elements and their properties in an expression. The following example demonstrates how to set a label's BackColor property to the other label's BackColor property value. [ReportItems.Label2].[BackColor] Tip [ReportItems] is a plain list that provides access to all report items at one level. Note You cannot use the ReportItems collection in a Calculated Field 's expression. Specify Images for Picture Boxes When you specify an expression for the Picture Box 's ImageSource property, you can use image Id s from the report's ImageResources collection. IIf([MarchSales]>20, [Images.ArrowUp],[Images.ArrowDown]) Variables Variable Description Example DataSource.RowCount Returns the total amount of data rows in a data source. [DataSource.RowCount] != 0 Result: When using this expression for a control's Visible property, the control is not displayed if there is no data in the data source. DataSource.CurrentRowIndex Returns a zero-based index of the current data row in a data source. Iif([DataSource.CurrentRowIndex] % 2 = 0, 'red', 'green') Result: When this expression is used for a table row's BackColor property, odd rows are colored in red and even rows - in green. DataSource.CurrentRowHierarchyLevel Returns a zero-based level of the current row in a hierarchical report . Iif([DataSource.CurrentRowHierarchyLevel] == 0, Rgb(231,235,244), ?) Result: When this expression is used for the BackColor property of the Detail band that is printed in tree mode, the root level rows are highlighted. Note These variables are not valid when the report includes a table or contents . Use Report Parameters Use the following syntax to insert report parameters in an expression: Type a question mark before a parameter's name. ?parameter1 ( Obsolete approach ) Use the \"Parameters.\" prefix before a report parameter 's name. [Parameters.parameter1] Verify Collection Elements Use brackets \"[]\" to check if a collection contains an element that satisfies your condition. The following expression returns true if the Accounts collection contains at least one element that satisfies the [Amount] == 100 condition: [Accounts][[Amount] == 100] The following expression returns false if the Accounts collection is empty: [Accounts][] Specify Parent Relations Use the '^' parent relation operator to refer to a parent in expressions that are written in the context of a child. You can apply this operator successively to span multi-level parent relationships. You can use this operator to refer to the currently processed report group. This allows you to calculate aggregates within groups, as shown in the following expression: [][[^.CategoryID] == [CategoryID]].Sum([UnitPrice]) Refer to the Calculate an Aggregate Function topic for details. Grouping Clauses with Brackets It is important to use brackets to ensure that your expression returns the intended results. For instance, the following expression for objects of the Customer type returns all of the Customers where an Account exists with a Date of 8/25/2006 and where an account exists with an Amount of 100: [Accounts][[Date] == #8/25/2006#] && [Accounts][[Amount] == 100] Construct the expression as in the following example to search for all Customers that have an Account with both a Date of 8/25/2006 and an Amount of 100: [Accounts][[Date] == #8/25/2006# && [Amount] == 100] Change Operator Precedence When an expression contains multiple operators, their precedence controls the order in which expression elements are evaluated. Literal values Parameters Identifiers OR (left-associative) AND (left-associative) The '.' relationship qualifier (left-associative) ==, != <, >, <=, >= -, + (left-associative) *, /, % (left-associative) NOT unary - In Iif Trim(), Len(), Substring(), IsNull() '[]' (for set-restriction) '()' The default precedence can be changed by grouping elements with parentheses. For instance, the operators are performed in a default order in the first of the following two code samples. In the second code sample, the addition operation is performed first, because its associated elements are grouped with parentheses, and the multiplication operation is performed last. Accounts[Amount == 2 + 48 * 2] Accounts[Amount == (2 + 48) * 2] Case Sensitivity Operators are case insensitive. Although field values’ case sensitivity depends on the data source. Note Data source specifics affect certain operators' behavior. For instance, SQL Server Express 2005 is configured as case insensitive. In this case, the following expression always evaluates to true : Lower(Name) == Upper(Name) Escape Keywords You can mark a keyword-like field name with the @ escape character. In the expression below, the CriteriaOperator.Parse method interprets @Or as a field named \"Or\", not the logical operator OR. @Or = 'value' Escape Characters Use a backslash () as an escape character for characters in an expression, as shown below: \\[ \\\\ \\'"

World Countries - a map of the world Europe - a map of Europe Asia - a map of Asia North America - a map of North America South America - a map of South America Africa - a map of Africa USA - a map of the USA Canada - a map of Canada Note The World Countries map has a lower level of detail than maps of specific regions and may not contain some of the countries. As an alternative, you can load a custom map with required granularity. To select a required default map, go to the Common section of the Options menu and use the Default Map dropdown list. Custom Maps The Web Dashboard uses a Shapefile vector format to provide custom maps. Commonly, this format includes two file types: .shp file - holds map shapes (points/lines/polygons) .dbf file - contains attributes for each shape. To provide a custom map, go to the Common section of the Options menu and change the Default Map value to Custom . Finally, provide shape data using one of the following ways. Specify a path to the .shp file using the Custom Map URL option. Attributes from the corresponding .dbf file located in the same directory will automatically be included in the map. Load the existing shapefile using the ellipsis button next to the Custom Map File option. In the invoked dialog, locate the required .shp file. Use the Custom Attribute File option to locate the .dbf file containing attributes for each shape. Note that custom maps created in the Cartesian coordinate system are not supported. Map Attributes After you select the default or custom map, you can display supplementary information (such as the name of a country, state, etc.). To do this, go to the Options menu and open the Attribute Name dropdown list. This list displays available attributes for the current map.

    "title": "Bar Code Recognition Specifics | Metric Analitic, End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Bar Code Recognition Specifics This document describes the main specifics of bar code recognition and how to resolve the most frequently encountered issues when working with bar codes. Choose an Appropriate Bar Code Type Selecting an appropriate bar code type (symbology) depends on your specific business requirements and the applied industrial standards. In general, consider using Bar Code 2 of 5 Interleaved for encoding digits and Bar Code 39 for encoding the full range of ASCII characters. Insert the Function Code One Character (FNC1) or the Application Identifier into a Bar Code Some encodings enable you to insert a special FNC1 character for separating application identifiers from the rest of the bar code. According to the GS1 specification, the FNC1 character is always inserted at the first position of the encoded data. Other identifiers can be inserted manually using the default \" # \" character. Although you can use any ASCII character as the FNC1 placeholder, it will not be a part of the encoded data as it does not have any direct ASCII representation. Note For the Code 128 symbology, only FNC1 characters are currently supported. At present, there is no way to define FNC2 - 4 characters for this bar code. For the list of the available application identifiers, refer to the official documentation at www.gs1.org . Specify the Bar Code Resolution on Export to Third-Party Formats At present, only export to PDF preserves the original bar code in its vector form. Export to other formats will keep only the rasterized version of a bar code (with the default DPI set to 96 ). For XLSX and XLS export, the output resolution can be set up manually using the Rasterization Resolution property. Common Issues This document section provides solutions to the most common issues that you may encounter when creating bar codes. The bar code is too \"dense\" The more information you wish to encode, the more bars should be drawn and the larger the bar code should become. The bar code's Module property specifies the width of the narrowest bar in a bar code. Although you can set this property to a very small value, the actual value is determined by the maximum resolution of your bar code printer device. Alternatively, consider using the Auto Module option to automatically calculate the optimal bar size based on the current bar code dimensions. Note When bar codes are \"dense\" and you are manually specifying the Module value, make sure that multiplying this value by the bar code printer resolution results in an integer number. Otherwise, rounding errors may occur on calculating the resulting bar width. For example, when the Module is set to 0.015 inches and the printer resolution is 300 DPI, their product equals 4.5 , which may be rounded to 4 or 5 pixels for different bars and result in bar code recognition errors. In this case, the Module property should be set to 0.01333 (to make the bar width equal to 4 pixels) or to 0.01667 (to make the bar width equal to 5 pixels). The bar code is correctly displayed on the preview but it is not scanned Make sure that your scanner has been correctly set up to be able to recognize a specific kind of a bar code. If you are not certain about how to operate the scanner properly, please refer to its product manual. Avoid scanning bar codes from the monitor screen (e.g., using an application installed on your smartphone), because the screen DPI may not be sufficient to effectively recognize each particular bar. The bar code is correctly displayed on the preview but it is scanned incorrectly The cause for this problem may be an encoding issue specific to the \"binary\" input mode. By default, the UTF-16 encoding is used. However, your scanner device may use a different encoding model or even a codepage (i.e., a specific table that maps abstract values to real human-understandable characters). For additional information on this subject, please refer to the specification of your scanner device. The \"There are invalid characters in the text\" error occurs Different bar code symbologies define different ranges of allowed characters under different character sets. To avoid this error, please check the bar code specification."

    "keywords": "Character Comb Overview The Character Comb control displays text so that each character is printed in an individual cell. To add a Character Comb to the report, drag the Character Comb item from the Toolbox onto the report's area. The number of cells displayed by the control in Print Preview depends on the Can Shrink and Auto Width settings. If both these properties are enabled, the number of cells corresponds to the number of characters in the control's text. Otherwise, the number of cells corresponds to the specified cell size and the control size. See the Content Layout and Position section to learn more on using these properties. You can also adjust the character comb's size to match its characters using the Fit Bounds To Text command in the Actions category: If the Word Wrap option is enabled, the command keeps control content displayed in multiple lines. It decreases the control's height and adjusts the width to fit this content. If the Word Wrap option is disabled, the command adjusts the control's height and width to completely display the control's content in a single line. As a result, the number of cells corresponds to the number of characters. When exporting this control to third-party formats, consider the following When a report is exported to an XLS or XLSX file, the cells of the Character Comb correspond to the cells of a resulting Excel sheet. When a report is exported to a CSV (or TXT ) file, the content of individual cells is separated (or spaced) by a specified Separator character. In most aspects, the Character Comb is similar to the Label control from which it inherits most of its properties and its basic behavior. For general information about binding these controls to data and display summary function results, see the Label topic. To learn about Character Comb specifics, see the following sections in this document. Main Options The following properties are specific to the Character Comb control: Cell Vertical Spacing and Cell Horizontal Spacing Specify the spacing between adjacent cells (measured in report units ). These values do not depend on the specified border width of a control. The following image illustrates a Character Comb with Cell Vertical Spacing set to 15 and Cell Horizontal Spacing set to 5 . Border Width Specifies the width of cell borders in pixels, as a floating point value. When the cell spacing is set to zero, the borders of adjacent cells are merged (i.e., the actual border width is not doubled). The following images illustrate how cell spacing affects the Border Width property behavior: Cell Spacing = 0 Cell Spacing = 1 When the control's content is to be printed on multiple pages, a page break horizontally splits the cell border based on the cell spacing setting, as shown below. Cell Spacing = 0 Cell Spacing > 0 Cell Size Mode Specifies whether or not the cell size should depend on the current font size of a control. The following cell size modes are supported: Custom The cell size is determined by the Cell Height and Cell Width property values and does not depend on the assigned font size. With this setting, the actual cell size is less than the specified Cell Height and CellWidth by the Border Width value. Auto Size The cell size depends on the current font size of a control (the Cell Height and Cell Width properties are ignored). With this setting, the actual cell size does not depend on the specified border width of a control. Auto Height Only the cell height depends on the current font size of a control (the Cell Height property is ignored), and the Cell Width value is specified manually. With this setting, the following behavior is expected: The actual cell height does not depend on the specified border width of a control. The actual cell width is the difference between the specified Cell Width and Border Width values. Auto Width Only the cell width depends on the current font size of a control (the Сell Width property is ignored), and Cell Height value is specified manually. With this setting, the following behavior is expected: The actual cell width does not depend on the specified border width of a control. The actual cell height is the difference between the specified Cell Height and Border Width values. Content Layout and Position This section describes the Character Comb properties that affect the control's position on a page and content layout.

Layout Concepts Item Resizing Maximize and Restore Item Item Positioning Layout Concepts Item Resizing Maximize and Restore Item Item Positioning Layout Concepts The dashboard arranges dashboard items and groups using layout items and layout groups . They are special containers that are used to present a dashboard layout as a hierarchical structure. A layout item is used as a container that displays an individual dashboard item. A layout group is used as a container that is used to arrange layout items (or other layout groups) either horizontally or vertically. At the same time, layout groups are used as containers that display dashboard item groups. Thus, a dashboard layout is hierarchically arranged from the root layout group to bottommost layout items, which display individual dashboard items. Item Resizing You can resize individual items/groups of items by dragging their edges. For this, follow the steps below. In the area allowing you to resize items, cursor types will be changed to column resize / row resize . Left-click and drag the cursor until you get the expected sizes and release the left mouse button. The dashboard items change their sizes. Maximize and Restore Item You can expand any dashboard item to fit the dashboard to examine data in greater detail. The expanded dashboard item size in this case is the same as the root layout group. Click the Maximize button in the dashboard item caption to maximize a dashboard item. Click Restore to restore the item's size. Item Positioning You can change the position of a dashboard item by using drag-and-drop and the dashboard item's Move button. Depending on the required dashboard item position, a new layout group is created (if required) to maintain the arrangement of items. Thus, the dashboard item can be inserted to the desired area of a new or existing dashboard layout group. The following steps illustrates how a dashboard item is dragged. Select a dashboard item and hover the Move button. Drag the dashboard item to the expected area and release the left mouse button when the drop indicator displays the required area. The dashboard item is moved to a new position."

    "keywords": "Specify Query Parameters This document provides general information on query parameters and describes common ways of utilizing parametrized SQL queries to filter data at the data source level. Query Parameters Overview A query parameter holds an external value that is inserted into an SQL statement before query execution. This value can be either static or dynamically generated by an associated expression. The query parameter value is inserted into the resulting SQL query string in the \"@QueryParameterName\" placeholder's position. Query parameters are used in the following scenarios: When filtering report data at the data source level using the Query Builder . The Query Builder helps you construct SQL queries when creating a new data-bound report or binding an existing report to an SQL data source , ... or when adding queries to an existing SQL data source or editing existing queries. You can filter the constructed queries using query parameters. Expand the Parameters section in the Query Builder to add a new query parameter. Expand the Query Properties section and click the Filter property's ellipsis button to invoke the Filter Editor and filter data using the created query parameters. The criteria based on the specified query parameters are added as an SQL statement's WHERE part. When binding a report to a stored procedure provided by an SQL data source. The Data Source Wizard include the following page. If you select a stored procedure, the wizard creates a query parameter for each procedure parameter and allows you to configure the query parameters in the next Configure query parameters page. Configure Query Parameters The following properties are available for each query parameter: Name - specifies the parameter's name. Type - specifies the parameter value's data type. Expression - determines whether the actual parameter value is static or generated dynamically. Value - determines the query parameter's actual value. If the Expression option is enabled, the actual parameter value is produced dynamically by calculating an associated expression. This is useful when you map the query parameter value to the report parameter value. Refer to the next document section for more information. Provide the Query Parameter Value Below, you can see how a value is specified for a query parameter within the Data Source Wizard's page. You can also specify query parameter values in the Report Wizard or the Query Parameters dialog in the same way. Specifying a static value Choose a query parameter's value type and set a static value to the Value property according to the selected type. Providing a dynamic value Create a complex expression by expanding the Type property's drop-down list and selecting Expression . Click the Value property's ellipsis button and construct an expression in the invoked Expression Editor . You can map a report parameter that already exists in a report to a query parameter. Pass a Multi-Value Parameter Value to a Query You can map multi-value parameters to query parameters. For instance, the following query selects the orders whose IDs can be found within the values the @OrderID query parameter provides. Pass a Multi-Value Report Parameter Value to a Stored Procedure You cannot pass a multi-value parameter value to a stored procedure directly. Use one of the following expression functions: Use the Join() expression function to convert the array of parameter values to a string if you use MS SQL Server, MySQL or Oracle database systems. Use the CreateTable() expression function to prepare a table using values of several multi-value parameters."

Expression Bindings Expression bindings enable you to use complex expressions that include two or more fields and various functions. Expressions also allow you to calculate complex summaries without scripts and conditionally shape your data without formatting rules. This mode is enabled in the Report Designer if it provides the Expressions panel. Data Bindings Standard data bindings enable you to assign a single data field to a report control or use report scripts to provide custom logic. This mode is enabled in the Report Designer if it does not provide the Expressions panel. Conversion Dialog The following dialog appears only when expression bindings are enabled in the Report Designer, and you open an existing report that uses standard data bindings : This dialog prompts you to convert your report to use expressions (the new binding mechanism). Click Yes to run the report conversion, click No to open the report without changes. See the section below for information on how to use expressions instead of data bindings. Binding Mode Comparison Bind to a Single Data Field The Field List panel allows you to drop fields onto the design surface or existing report controls. All binding ways are identical in the data bindings and expression bindings modes. You can select a report control and bind it to data in the Properties panel.

The next wizard page allows you to specify whether you want to use an existing data connection or create a new data connection. If you prefer to create a new data connection, specify its settings. You can use a Web Service Endpoint, a filename, or a string with JSON data. In this example, the JSON data is obtained from a JSON sample data location . Specify request parameters (username and password, path parameters, query parameters, or HTTP headers). A path parameter appends a path element to a JSON endpoint's URI. A query parameter specifies a HTTP request parameter that is passed to a JSON endpoint. A header parameter adds a custom HTTP header to JSON endpoint requests. You can click the parameter's button and use an expression to set the parameter value. Click the Value property's ellipsis button. Specify the expression in the invoked Expression Editor and click OK . Expressions can include report parameters . In the Expression Editor , expand Parameters , select a report parameter to which you want to bind the path parameter, query parameter, or header parameter, and click OK . Note The Data Source Wizard sends a request to the endpoint with the specified parameters to populate the data source and build the data source schema. Ensure that the parameters are always set to the values that the endpoint expects. Otherwise, the Data Source Wizard generates an error on the next steps. For instance, if a user specifies the name of a JSON file in a parameter, specify the default file name in order to avoid an error. Path parameters, query parameters, and header parameters are included in endpoint requests in the same order as they are listed. Move a parameter up or down in the list to change its position in endpoint requests. The Resulting URI read-only field shows how the resulting JSON URI looks. This wizard page also shows the specified JSON data's structure. You can choose all nodes or a subset of nodes. Uncheck the data fields that your report does not require.

This document describes how to add the most commonly used controls to a report. See Use Report Elements for a complete list of available controls. Display Text Use the following controls to display text in a report: Label Displays plain text in a report. Rich Text Displays rich text in a report. You can apply different font settings to the control's content and load content from an external HTML file. Table Contains any number of cells arranged in one or more rows. Each table cell can display plain text or contain other controls. Character Comb Displays each character in a separate cell and can be used to create printed forms. Double-click any of these controls to invoke an in-place editor where you can enter text. Press CTRL+Enter to submit changes and close this mode. You can use corresponding properties of the Appearance category to access the selected control's font and alignment settings. Labels and other text-oriented controls can display the following content: Static content A control's content does not change once it is specified in a published document. Dynamic content A connected data source supplies this content. In a published document, it changes according to the printed data source record. You can use the Format String Editor to format dynamic content. Mixed content You can combine labels' and other text-oriented controls' static and dynamic content within the same control. Use the Format String property in the Action category to format this field's value. Display Page Information Use the Page Info control to display information about document pages, such as the current page number and/or total number of pages. You can also use this control to add information about a report's author and the document's creation date. See the following tutorials for detailed instructions: Add Page Numbers Display the User Name in a Report Display the Current Date and Time in a Report Display Check Boxes, Images and Bar Codes Drop a Boolean data field from the Field List onto a report to create a Check Box control bound to that field.

An extra click is required to begin any actual filtering operation, because the standard filter mode shows all items selected. This is not an optimal implementation for performance reasons, because it generates filtering criteria that are evaluated by the data layer and/or the database. To solve these issues, the Neutral Filter Mode is implemented. It is neutral in the sense that it does not apply any criteria to the data source in its default state, resulting in improved performance. All items are shown deselected. This means that an extra click is no longer required in the most common scenarios, and this behavior is familiar to end users from websites world-wide. The Neutral Filter Mode helps in a situation when there is a potential “dead lock”, due to the fact that multiple filter elements influence each other.
